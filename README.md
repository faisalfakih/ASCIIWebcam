# ASCIIWebcam

## Introduction
This program uses OpenCV to capture video from your webcam and convert it into real-time ASCII art. It captures frames from the webcam, converts them to grayscale, resizes them, and then maps each pixel's brightness to a corresponding ASCII character to create an ASCII art representation.

## Requirements
- OpenCV library
- C++ compiler
- Webcam

## Installation
1. Ensure you have OpenCV installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [OpenCV's official website](https://opencv.org/releases/).
2. Clone this repository or download the source code.
